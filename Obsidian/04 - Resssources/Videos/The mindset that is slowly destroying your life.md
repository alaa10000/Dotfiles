Change your mindset.

you brainwashed yourself with the help of ads and social conditioning into thinking you like doing things that destroy you.

In reality, "the things you should do" are the things that you want to do and that you truly love.

for example, you don't like video games but you instead enjoy finishing your homework or reading a book more.
