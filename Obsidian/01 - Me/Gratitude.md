I'm grateful for you mom because of much chores you go trough to give us a better life. Every school day you wake up the first to make us breakfast AND and our school meals. i truly don't know how you do that is a short period of time. I'm also grateful for the smile you welcome us with every time we come from school. It's truly positive.

I'm grateful for this computer that my dad bought me which is so much more powerful and better than my laptop. I'm also grateful for this watch that i got which is pretty expensive and cool looking. Finally, i'm grateful for this home we are living in which warms us, and give us some privacy from the world.

I'm grateful for this phone. It's minimal and has everything I need. I'm also grateful for this school which is so much better than the one in Morocco. It has activities, sports and actual interesting sessions.
