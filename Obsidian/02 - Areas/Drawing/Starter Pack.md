1. Break the reference into simple shapes.
2. Learn the anatomy of the subject.
3. Combine

**Sketch** then **draw**.

Start with breaking the form into simple shapes then as you get advanced you'll be able to draw with less sketching.

Level 1 Form tracing: Trace wrapping lines over forms in 3D.

Level 2 Cross section: Draw blob shapes then make then three-dimensional by adding lines wrapping around them. You can also cut them.

Level 3 Freeform boxes: Draw A LOTS of boxes with different rotations without worrying about them being perfect or with hard edges.

Level 4 Form manipulation: Manipulate boxes by squashing, stretching or twisting them. Also, add them to other shapes to create forms.

level 5 Cube rotations: Rotate cubes in space while keeping the good proportions.
