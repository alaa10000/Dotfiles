#### Hypertrophy

- Lighter / Less weight
- Easier
- Till failure
- Quantity over quality
- 5 to 10 sets
- >10 reps
- Fast reps

Rest: 2 minutes max

#### Strength

Note: If an exercise is hard, build both muscle and strength using an easier one.
Ex: If you're struggling with dips, you should aim to create hypertrophy with push-ups.

- Heavier / More weight
- Harder
- Stop as soon as form/quality starts to break
- Quality over quantity
- Sets doesn't matter
- 1 to 8 perfect reps
- Try to the movement reps fast without sacrificing form

Rest: 3-5 minutes (minimum 3)


#### The Golden Rule
Train as **specific** as possible, as **intense** as possible, as **frequently** as possible while being able to **recover**.
