- Don't wait for that one gem and perfect idea, all project started with one crappy and half good idea

 start with a bad idea and develop it, prototype it and iterated it into a good one.

Keep a notebook to jot down inspiration that comes from mechanics in other games, things from movies, ads and stuff that can be turned into a game.

- The faster you can have bad ideas the more freely they will come to you.
