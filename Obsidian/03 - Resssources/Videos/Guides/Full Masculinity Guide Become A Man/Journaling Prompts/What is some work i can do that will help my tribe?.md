This is a very difficult question that requires a lot of thinking. First thing first, my tribe is my only my family. I think something that will really help my tribe is being organized. This will allow me to make more time for my family, be able to hang out with them and relieve them from worrying about me in general. Also, develop my skills and become the best in the world in them so i can make money off them in the future to retire my fucking family.
