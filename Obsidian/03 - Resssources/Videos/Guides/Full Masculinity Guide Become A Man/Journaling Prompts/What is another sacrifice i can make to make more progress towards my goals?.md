i need to sacrifice a lot of things to make progress towards my goals and purpose. The most important one is to remove my porn addiction as it drains my dopamine levels which makes me less motivated, it makes me feel bad after doing it so i cant do anything and it also fucks my brain up into only thinking about women and sex. I also need to sleep at 10 pm and wake up at 6 am so i can follow my plan and actually get closer to my goals. Finally, i will sacrifice junk food and excessive eating so i can stay lean and not make calisthenics harder for me.
