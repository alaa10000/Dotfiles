I honestly think that the Love/Belonging stage is the one i need to fulfill. Currently I only have like one true friend between all the fake, toxic ones. So I need to make new friends and develop new connections. I also want to fulfill the love part and get closer to girls.
The big fucking problem that is currently holding me from achieving these dreams is Social anxiety. So the first thing i must do is target it and make it disappear.
