1. Understanding Willpower: 
- Willpower is the skill of resisting your desires 
- There are two kinds of desires: 
	- Low Level Desires: These are the junk food, video games or porn which you already knew. 
	- High Level Desires: These are more like working too hard, being too muscular or being too ambitious etc. These desires are even more destructive than lower level desires. 

1. Lust: 
- What we should do is that we should remove these lustful things from our environment and try to hide them. 

- Whenever you get a desire for porn, try to remove that thought from your mind by thinking of a memory which was pleasant and positive that will make you happy. 

- Or as soon as you get the urge for porn, say NO loud and firm and go on doing another task such as your work. 

- Do not entertain your urges as you will have a higher chance of doing that bad habit 

- Unsubscribe from useless content that triggers you. 

- Extra Tip: Limit your daily use of technology and go outside more.
