1. Understanding Willpower: 
- Willpower is the skill of resisting your desires 
- There are two kinds of desires: 
	- Low Level Desires: These are the junk food, video games or porn which you already knew. 
	- High Level Desires: These are more like working too hard, being too muscular or being too ambitious etc. These desires are even more destructive than lower level desires. 

1. Lust: 
- What we should do is that we should remove these lustful things from our environment and try to hide them. 

- Whenever you get a desire for porn, try to remove that thought from your mind by thinking of a memory which was pleasant and positive that will make you happy. 

- Or as soon as you get the urge for porn, say NO loud and firm and go on doing another task such as your work. 

- Do not entertain your urges as you will have a higher chance of doing that bad habit 

- Unsubscribe from useless content that triggers you. 

- Extra Tip: Limit your daily use of technology and go outside more.

Video Games: - Leveling up in the real world is far better than levelling up in video games. - It has been shown that when a person gets complimented for his work, he is far more likely to delay gratification. - Try to be positive to yourself. Sometimes you may not feel positive about yourself. You may have to put positive thoughts in your brain forcefully. - So take a few seconds to think positive about yourself daily. You don't need others to compliment you. - The best way to quit video games is to replace it with another activity which has a similar feeling of progression and achievement. By far the best is weightlifting/calisthenics. - You also probably should stop being friends with video gamers if you really want to quit it. - It is better to be alone than to be with negative influences. 

4. Sugar: - It has been shown that if you are sad you'll be far less likely to resist your urges and delay gratification. - You can control which emotions that you feel and you do it by manually putting a thought(either sad or happy) inside of your mind. - So try to think of pleasant thoughts. It will make you far more likely to delay gratification. - Try to think to yourself everyday what the dream result you're waiting out for in your work or in the gym. - Willpower Training: Buy your all time favorite treat and keep it in your desk. Now, stare at it and just observe the emotions and thoughts that arises. Journal and ask these questions to yourself 'Why does these emotions have power over me?' and 'Why do I feel an Urge to indulge in it right now. This will drain your willpower but that's how you level it up. - Warning: Do not try this practice for porn. 

5. Hot Triggers: - A person who is disciplined is not always disciplined, he is disciplined when the environment is the same. So, if its tough for you to be disciplined you just may not be in the right environment. - Be honest and try to find out what your hot triggers could be. For some it may be a sexually attractive women. - So, try to find out what triggers you the most. - In Dr Andrew Huberman's podcast, he talked about 'Failure Forecasting'. The idea is that we should take some dedicated time every now and then to think about the ways that we could actually fail the obstacles that could arise so that we can plan to overcome them. Try to do this once every few weeks or months. - If you really want to be disciplined you should set up an environment which are going to support your goals and the character traits that you want. - Journal these questions 'What could be my hot triggers?' and 'How could I set up an environment where those hot triggers don't bother me?'.
