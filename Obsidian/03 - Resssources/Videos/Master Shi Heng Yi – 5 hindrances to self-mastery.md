5 Hindrances (obstacles) to Self-Mastery 

1. Sensual desire (sight/touch/taste/smell/hearing): having temptations or being addicted to something that gives you positive emotions. 

2. Ill will / aversion: rejecting or having negatives emotions because you are disliking an object, a situation or a person.

3. Dullness / heaviness: characterized by non-motivated, lack of energy or a state of depression. 

4. Restlessness: overthinking, trapped in thoughts and unable to stay in the present.

5. Skeptical doubt: being indecisive and having too many doubts.

**Structure your life in a way to prevent those hindrances from arising.** 

if not successful then use:

**Rain**
   **R**ecognize which state of mind you're experiencing.

   **A**ccept that's what you're experiencing.

   **I**nvestigate: 'why did this state of mind come up' 'what will be the consequences if i remain in this state'.

   **N**on-identify with that experience: 'i am not the body, i am not the mind, i am not my emotion' its just that i can see all these aspects.
