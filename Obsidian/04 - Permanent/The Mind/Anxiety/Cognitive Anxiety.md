Cognitive anxiety is only exists in the mind and its vehicle is thoughts.

It ca cause: racing and looping thoughts, worst case scenarios.

~ you can't solve it just by thinking harder ~

**you need to step back and question the thoughts instead of fighting them.** You must change your relationship with your thoughts, unload what's stuck and make sure your brain has the rest it needs to stay stable.
#### To treat:

1. Metacognitive Therapy: noticing the beliefs you hold about your thoughts. ex: if stop worrying or trying to control everything something bad will happen - my hyper vigilance keeps me safe.
	Catch those beliefs and yourself: Is this thought true? Is it useful? Do i actually need to listen to it?
2. Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy: you train yourself to observe thoughts without immediately reacting to them. Just watching thoughts flow.
3. Journal Speak: 10 - 15 mins of writing your uncensored thoughts and emotions with no concern for grammar. You just release all the thoughts then you can throw it.
4. Sleep: your brain has less capacity to regulate emotions if your under rested.
