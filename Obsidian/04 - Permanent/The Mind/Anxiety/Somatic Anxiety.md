Somatic anxiety is when the mind is calm but the body is not because it's holding stress, trauma or negative experiences and not letting go.

It can cause: tension, restlessness, digestive issues.

#### To treat:

1. EMDR Therapy: eye movement desensitization reprocessing. Helps you process stuck memories and stress patterns and release all of it.
2. Trauma Releasing Exercises: you let your body trimmer or move out stored tension
3. Breath Work: active approaches like Box Breathing(in 4, pause 4, hold 4, out 4) or Resonance Breathing(lie down and close your eyes and mouth, slowly breath in for 6, exhale for 6).
