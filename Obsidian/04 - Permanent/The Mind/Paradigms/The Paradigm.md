The paradigm is the program or the OS that exists in the sub-conscious mind.

It controls how we use our mind, our habitual behaviors, creates our self-image and dictates our results.

it is why we don't do things that we know how to do.
Ex: You do a public speaking and your whole nervous system blows up because of your paradigm.

To change the results, you must change the paradigm.

#### Changing The Paradigm
you must create a beautiful picture of yourself and keep reprogramming it into your paradigm over and over again until you create a new self-image and that it turns into a desire.  You can do this by writing a description of that image on a sheet of paper and reading it A LOT while every time being emotionally evolved in it.

In other words, you write a script or a description of a character you want to be and keep reading it until you believe it and start acting on it.

Plus, you can also start developing 1 or 2 habits that go with new image you created for example.
