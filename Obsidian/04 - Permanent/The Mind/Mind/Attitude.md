1. Have a winning attitude

2. Set a goal: set a precise and fantasy goal that you want.
	ex: 10k a month

3. Change paradigm: replace bad beliefs with good and positive ones that are aligned with the habits you want.
	ex: I'm so broke -> I am so happy and grateful now that money comes to me in increasing quantities, through multiple sources on a continuous basis.
