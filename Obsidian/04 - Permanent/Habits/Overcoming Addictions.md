# Overcoming Bad Habits

- [x] The first thing is to admit that there is a problem and that you're addicted to the habit

- [x] Have a purpose or a reason why you want to quit. Write it down

- [x] Choose a quit date and write it down so the journey become important

- [x] Know and avoid triggers of the habit at all cost or, at least, be ready to deal with them when they show up. And avoid people that do the habit

- [ ] As soon as the urge to the bad habit comes, remind yourself of your why, your reason and your purpose

* Don't chase streaks, chase the reason.
