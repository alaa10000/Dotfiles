# The Habit Loop

Here is how habits actually work:
1. **The Trigger**: what signals your brain to start the routine
2. **The Routine**: the actually process of the habit
3. **The Reward**: the recompense of the routine like dopamine spike, less stress, etc.

The more one does the routine, the stronger and easier it is to do it again.
