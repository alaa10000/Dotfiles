# Consistency

Don't set very high expectations everyday because there will be a time where you will have less willpower than others. 

So the important thing is to just show up to get closer to the automaticity line as the most important thing is consistency.

The solution is to set a minimum and a maximum. Here is how it works: 

- the minimum is there so you don't scare your brain in days where you don't have much willpower so you can still show up and get closer to the automaticity line.

- The maximum is to get the benefits of the habits and to also motivate you to do more than the minimum.

For example, if you're really tired one day, you can have a minimum of 30 min and a maximum of 1 or 2 hours.
